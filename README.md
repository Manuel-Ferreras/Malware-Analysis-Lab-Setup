 <h1> Downloading and installing Oracle's VirtualBox hypervisor to create a Malware Analysis sandbox virtual.</h1>

 - step:1 Start opening a web browser to Virtualbox and click Download Virtualbox7.0.

  <h1> Setting up a second network adapter to use when detonating malware in our malware analysis environment.</h1>

 - step:1 After installing Virtualbox open the tools menu and click Network You'll see the default ethernet adapter created during installation we would need a second one.

-  Step:2: Click the "Create" button to start creating a new adapter.

-  Step:3 After creating the adapter, double-click on it to access its settings.

-  Step:4 Look for an option labeled "Configure Adapter Manually" and click on it. This step might be necessary if it's not the default setting.

-  Step:5 Since the default adapter is using the IP address 192.168.x.x, and you want to use the private IP range 10.0.0.x, proceed to set the IPv4 address to 10.0.0.1.

-  Step:6 Leave the network mask (subnet mask) unchanged. Typically, it should be set to something like 255.255.255.0.

- Step:7 Click on the "DHCP Server" tab to access the DHCP server settings.
- Step:8 Find the checkbox to enable the DHCP server and check it to enable the server.
- Step:9 Set the server address to 10.0.0.2. This is the IP address that the DHCP server will use.
- Step:10 Leave the server mask (subnet mask) as it is. Typically, it should be set to something like 255.255.255.0.
- Step:11 Set the lower address bound to 10.0.0.3. This is the first IP address that the DHCP server will assign to devices.
- Step:12 Set the upper address bound to 10.0.0.254. This defines the range of IP addresses that the DHCP server can assign to devices.
- Step:13 After configuring these DHCP server settings, click the "Apply" button in the bottom right corner to save the changes.
By following these steps, you'll have created a second network with the DHCP server enabled, providing IP addresses in the range of 10.0.0.3 to 10.0.0.254 for use with VMs in this network, which can be useful for malware analysis.
